        Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with Indian spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, and fish), or in some cases without any meat,[1] and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.[2]

Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[3] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.
